## EnsemblRest an R package for accessing the Ensembl REST API.

http://beta.rest.ensembl.org/

Still very much in development.

To install, clone this repository and type:

    R CMD INSTALL EnsemblRest

Just converts JSON to Lists of lists, so could be made much nicer (need to make time to write S3 classes for the different functions that can then be functionally accessed)
